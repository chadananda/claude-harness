# Domain: content — Blog & Article Writing

## Structure
H2 every 300-500 words — walls of text lose readers. Readability grade 8-12 — clear enough for generalists, substantial enough for experts. Sweet spot: 800-2500 words. Under 800 feels thin; over 2500, split into a series.

## SEO Headers — replace generic with keyword-rich
Generic headers are invisible to search. Every H2 should contain the topic keyword and signal value:
- "Introduction" → "Why [Topic] Transforms [Outcome]"
- "Background" → "The [Time] Journey of [Subject]"
- "Getting Started" → "Your First Steps in [Practice]"
- "Benefits" → "How [Practice] Changes [Result]"
- "Conclusion" → "Integrating [Topic] Into Your [Context]"

## Structural Cleanup
Bold-as-header (`**Section**`) → real H2. HR dividers (`---`) → descriptive headers. Hierarchy: H2→H3 only in body (H1 is title). Auto-add H2 when >500 words without one — the reader needs a landmark.

## Descriptions & Meta
150-160 characters. Start with action verb. Include value prop. This is the search snippet — it sells the click.
- Bad: "An article about meditation techniques."
- Good: "Master three evidence-based meditation techniques that reduce anxiety in under 10 minutes daily."

## Image Placement — quality over quantity
Place images at: major concept transitions, complex ideas needing visualization, emotional moments requiring pause, practical demonstrations. Never: mid-thought, minor transitions, simple lists, forced spacing. Typical: 2-5 images per article. Every image needs descriptive alt text — accessibility and SEO both depend on it.

## Cross-Linking
3-10 internal links per article — enough for SEO value, not so many it reads like a Wikipedia rabbit hole. Max 1 link per 150-200 words. First occurrence only. Natural anchor text — never "click here." Related articles section at end: 3-5 links with a thematic header ("Continue Your Journey," "Further Reading," "Deeper Into [Topic]") — never generic "Related Articles."

## Quotes & Evidence
2-4 substantive quotes per article with attribution — builds authority and breaks up prose. Specific statistics with sources over vague claims. "Studies show" without a citation is worse than no claim at all.

## Author Bios — theme-specific
Vary the bio header and angle to match article content — not the same generic paragraph every time. A meditation article gets "About Your Guide"; a history piece gets "About the Historian." Connect author expertise specifically to the article topic.

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Every H2 contains topic keyword or signals clear value
- [ ] No section exceeds 500 words without a subheader
- [ ] Description: 150-160 chars, action verb, value prop
- [ ] Alt text on every image — descriptive, keyword-aware
- [ ] 3-10 internal links, naturally placed
- [ ] Readability: grade 8-12 (no jargon walls, no oversimplification)
- [ ] No orphan sections (single paragraph under a header looks incomplete)
