# Content Quality Gates

## Word Count Minimums (topical coverage floors, not targets)
| Page Type | Min Words | Unique % |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Homepage | 500 | 100% |
| Service/Feature | 800 | 100% |
| Blog Post | 1,500 | 100% |
| Location (primary) | 600 | 60%+ |
| Location (secondary) | 500 | 40%+ |
| Product Page | 400 | 80%+ |
| Category Page | 400 | 100% |
| Landing Page | 600 | 100% |
| FAQ Page | 800 | 100% |

Word count is NOT a direct ranking factor (confirmed by Google). Goal is comprehensive topical coverage — 500 thorough words outranks 2,000 unfocused words.

## Location Page Thresholds
- WARNING at 30+ pages: enforce 60%+ unique content (local landmarks, area-specific services, local team, local testimonials)
- HARD STOP at 50+ pages: require user justification + legitimate local presence + unique content strategy
- Doorway page signals: only city name changed, no local info, keyword-stuffed URLs

## Title Tags
30-60 characters. Primary keyword near beginning. Brand at end. Each page unique.

## Meta Descriptions
120-160 characters. Include CTA and primary keyword naturally. Each page unique.

## Image Alt Text
Required on all non-decorative images. 10-125 characters. Describe content, not "image" or filename. Decorative: `alt=""` or `role="presentation"`.

## Internal Linking
Blog (1,500+ words): 5-10 links. Service page: 3-5. Product: 2-4. Descriptive anchor text (not "click here"). No orphan pages.

## Safe vs Risky Programmatic Pages
Safe: integration pages (real docs), template/tool pages (unique functionality), glossary (200+ word definitions), product pages (unique specs/reviews)
Risky: location pages with only city swapped, "best X for Y" (thin), AI mass-generated (no unique value)

## Content Freshness
News: within hours/days. Evergreen blogs: review annually. Products: when specs change. Services: quarterly.
