# E-E-A-T Evaluation Framework
Updated per Sept 2025 QRG + Dec 2025 core update.

E-E-A-T now applies to ALL competitive queries, not just YMYL. Dec 2025 update: affiliate sites -71%, health -67%, ecommerce -52% average traffic drops for low E-E-A-T.

## Experience (20%)
First-hand knowledge signals. AI can generate expertise but cannot fabricate genuine experience — this is the key differentiator.
- Original photos/screenshots (not stock), case studies with specific details
- Before/after results, process documentation, personal anecdotes
- Strong: multiple first-hand signals. Weak: generic, no personal touch. None: clearly AI-generated/scraped.

## Expertise (25%)
- Author credentials relevant to topic (bio, certifications, byline visible)
- Technical accuracy, depth appropriate for audience, claims sourced
- Up-to-date with current developments

## Authoritativeness (25%)
- External citations, mentions in reputable media, industry recognition
- Consistent publication history, professional affiliations
- Author recognized by peers (speaking, publications)

## Trustworthiness (30%) — most important
- Contact info (physical address, phone, email), privacy policy, ToS
- HTTPS, customer reviews, transparent corrections, date stamps
- No deceptive practices (hidden ads, clickbait)

## YMYL (highest E-E-A-T required)
Health/safety, financial advice, legal info, news, elections/civic trust (added Sept 2025), groups of people.

## AI Content (Sept 2025 QRG)
AI content acceptable IF it demonstrates genuine E-E-A-T. Low-quality markers: generic phrasing, no unique insight, repetitive structure, no attribution, factual errors.

## New Spam Categories (2025)
Expired domain abuse, site reputation abuse, scaled content abuse.

## Scoring
90-100: Exceptional (authority site, recognized expert, full transparency)
70-89: Strong (demonstrated expertise, good trust signals)
50-69: Moderate (some signals, room for improvement)
30-49: Weak (minimal signals, significant gaps)
0-29: Very low (no signals, potential trust issues)
