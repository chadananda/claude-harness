# ICP Framework: 5-Layer Ideal Customer Profile

Build the ICP bottom-up: start with the problem, not the demographic. Layers compound — each one narrows and sharpens the profile.

## Layer 1: Problem Identity

Key questions:
- What specific problem triggers the search for a solution?
- What's the cost of NOT solving this problem? (time, money, frustration, risk)
- What event or milestone makes this problem urgent? (the "trigger event")

The trigger event is critical — it's the moment a latent problem becomes an active buying signal. Examples: new hire in the role, compliance deadline, failed audit, company hitting a growth threshold.

Common mistake: defining the problem too broadly ("businesses need better tools"). Narrow until you can describe a specific bad day the customer has.

Research method: Search complaints and forum posts, 1-star reviews on G2/Capterra/App Store, Reddit threads in relevant subreddits.

## Layer 2: Buyer Profile

Demographics:
- Company size (employees, revenue range)
- Industry vertical (be specific — "tech companies" is not a vertical)
- Geography (if relevant — regulatory or language constraints)

Role:
- Exact job title(s) — not "manager" but "Head of Customer Success" or "RevOps Manager"
- Department and reporting structure
- Budget authority: does this person approve spend, or do they require sign-off?

Decision dynamics:
- Solo buyer (self-serve, credit card) vs committee (procurement, security review, legal)?
- Technical evaluator vs business buyer? (often different people — both must be convinced)
- Who can kill the deal? (security, legal, CFO) — identify blockers early

Common mistake: targeting "everyone who could use this." Narrow to ONE specific buyer archetype first. Expand after product-market fit.

Research method: Job postings that mention this problem, LinkedIn Sales Navigator filters, conference speaker bios in the space.

## Layer 3: Psychographics

Values (pick the tensions that matter):
- Speed vs thoroughness
- Innovation vs stability
- Cost vs quality
- DIY vs done-for-you

Risk tolerance:
- Early adopter: wants cutting edge, tolerates bugs, loves being first
- Pragmatist: wants proven solutions, needs references, risk-averse
- Conservative: wants market leader, long evaluation cycle, needs executive buy-in

Current workaround — the most important psychographic signal:
- What cobbled-together solution do they use today? Spreadsheets? Manual process? Competitor they hate?
- How much friction does the workaround create? (High friction = high switching motivation)
- What would make them stop using their current solution TODAY?

Common mistake: ignoring psychographics entirely. Two CTOs at identical companies may have opposite buying behavior based on risk tolerance and values.

## Layer 4: Watering Holes

Online communities:
- Specific subreddits (not just r/startups — r/[exactniche])
- Discord servers and Slack groups (search "[industry] Slack", "[role] community")
- Facebook groups (especially strong for SMB and non-tech verticals)
- LinkedIn groups

Publications and media:
- Industry blogs and newsletters (search "[industry] newsletter", "[topic] weekly")
- Podcasts they listen to while commuting
- YouTube channels they follow for professional development
- Analyst reports they trust (Gartner, Forrester for enterprise)

Events:
- Annual conferences (search "[industry] conference [year]")
- Recurring meetups (Meetup.com, Eventbrite)
- Virtual summits and webinars

Influencers:
- Analysts, thought leaders, peer practitioners they follow and trust
- Who writes the most-shared content in this space?

Research method: `[role] community`, `[industry] Slack group`, `[topic] newsletter`, `[industry] conference [year]`

These watering holes become your distribution channels in the go-to-market phase — be exhaustive.

## Layer 5: Buying Behavior

Discovery (how they find new tools):
- Organic Google search when problem becomes urgent
- Peer recommendation from trusted colleague
- Review sites (G2, Capterra, Product Hunt)
- Social media (LinkedIn for B2B, Twitter/X for technical buyers)

Evaluation process:
- Free trial vs scheduled demo? (Self-serve vs sales-led)
- Compare features side-by-side vs read reviews?
- Technical evaluation (sandbox, API docs) vs business case (ROI calculator, case studies)?

Timeline:
- Days: self-serve impulse buy, low price point
- Weeks: small team decision, moderate price
- Months: enterprise procurement, security review, legal, compliance

Deal killers — know these before you build:
- Price: is your tier above or below their budget threshold?
- Security: SOC 2 required? GDPR compliance? Data residency?
- Integration: must connect to their existing stack (Salesforce, HubSpot, Jira)?
- Switching cost: data migration complexity, retraining existing users?

Research method: `[category] buying process`, `how to evaluate [product type]`, G2/Capterra review patterns for "cons" and "what problems are you solving"

## Common ICP Mistakes

1. **Too broad**: "SMBs that need software" — narrow to specific problem + role + trigger event
2. **Feature-focused**: Defining ICP by features wanted vs problem experienced — features change, problems persist
3. **Demographic-only**: Company size and industry alone don't predict buying behavior; psychographics and trigger events do
4. **Static**: ICP evolves as real customers teach you what you got wrong — revisit quarterly after launch
