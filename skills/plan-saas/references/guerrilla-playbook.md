# Guerrilla Marketing Playbook

## Pre-Launch Tactics (Weeks 1-6 before launch)

### Build-in-Public
- **Platform**: Twitter/X primary, LinkedIn secondary
- **Cadence**: 3-5 posts/week (mix of progress updates, learnings, numbers)
- **Content formula**: "Today I [specific thing]. Here's what I learned: [insight]. Numbers: [metric]."
- **What works**: revenue numbers, user counts, technical decisions with reasoning, failures and pivots
- **What doesn't**: vague "working on something exciting", motivational quotes, asking for follows
- **Expected results**: 500-2K followers in 12 weeks if consistent and genuinely insightful

### Viral Waitlist
- **Tools**: LaunchList, Waitlist.me, or custom with referral tracking
- **Mechanics**: Base position in queue. Move up by referring others.
- **Referral rewards**: 1 referral = move up 10 spots. 3 referrals = guaranteed early access. 10 referrals = founding member pricing.
- **Landing page**: clear value prop + waitlist form + referral incentive explanation
- **Email the waitlist** every 2 weeks with build-in-public updates to maintain engagement
- **Expected results**: 500-3K signups with good referral mechanics and active community presence

### Community Infiltration (the right way)
- **Goal**: become a recognized, helpful member BEFORE you ever mention your product
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks of value-add participation before any self-promotion
- **Method**: Answer questions in your domain. Share useful resources. Help people.
- Identify 5-10 communities where your ICP hangs out (from ICP watering holes research)
- Invest 30 min/day across 3-4 communities
- When you DO launch: you have credibility and your post won't be flagged as spam

### Cold Outreach (founder-to-founder)
- **Target**: 50-100 potential early adopters identified from community participation
- **Channel**: Email or Twitter DM (not LinkedIn — too spammy)
- **Template**: "Hey [name], I've seen your posts about [problem] in [community]. I'm building [product] to solve exactly this. Would you try the beta and give me honest feedback? [No ask for payment]"
- **Expected response rate**: 15-25% if you've built genuine community presence
- **Goal**: 20-30 beta users, NOT sales. Feedback > revenue at this stage.

## Launch Tactics (Launch Week)

### Product Hunt
- **Prep timeline**: 2 weeks before launch, prep all assets (video, screenshots, description, first comment, maker comment)
- **Hunter strategy**: Get a top hunter to post if possible (follow and engage with hunters 4+ weeks before). If not, self-post.
- **First-hour plan**: All waitlist + community members notified at launch time. Ask for upvotes + honest comments.
- **Day-of cadence**: Post at 12:01 AM PT. First comment explaining why you built this. Respond to EVERY comment within 1 hour.
- **Realistic expectations**: Top 5 gets 300-1K visitors. #1 Product of the Day gets 1K-5K visitors. Most won't convert immediately.

### Community Launch Posts
- Post in each community you've been active in
- **Format**: Story-based ("After 3 months of building, I'm launching [X]. Here's the backstory...")
- **Include**: what problem it solves, who it's for, launch offer (founding member pricing)
- **DO NOT**: post in communities where you haven't been active. It will be removed or ignored.

### Micro-Influencer Outreach
- Identify 10-20 creators with 1K-50K followers in your niche
- **Offer**: free lifetime access + referral commission (or just free access + genuine ask for feedback)
- Don't ask for a post. Ask for honest feedback. If they love it, they'll post organically.
- **Expected results**: 2-3 out of 20 will actively promote if the product is genuinely good

## Post-Launch Tactics (Weeks 2-12)

### Partnerships & Integrations
- Identify 3-5 complementary tools (not competitors) your ICP already uses
- Build integrations and get listed in their marketplace/directory
- Co-marketing: joint webinar, guest blog, or case study

### User-Generated Content
- Prompt users for testimonials at moment of delight (not at random)
- **Template**: "What was your life like before [product]? What changed?"
- Turn best testimonials into case studies (with permission)
- **Social proof display**: landing page, pricing page, comparison pages

### Referral Program
- Launch once you have 50+ active users (need base for referrals to work)
- **Incentive**: both sides get value (referrer gets free month, referee gets extended trial)
- Make sharing dead simple (one-click referral link, pre-written social text)

### Free Tool / Open Source Play
- Build a free standalone tool related to your product (calculator, checker, template generator)
- **Purpose**: SEO magnet + brand awareness + lead capture
- **Example**: If you sell email marketing SaaS, build a free subject line tester
