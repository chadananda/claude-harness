## Editorial Calendar Framework
- **Cadence**: 2 articles/week for first 12 weeks (24 total minimum)
- **Mix**: 40% BOFU, 35% MOFU, 25% TOFU (revenue-first, not traffic-first)
- **Production pipeline**: Outline (Day 1) → Draft (Day 2-3) → Edit (Day 4) → Publish + Promote (Day 5)
- **Batch production**: Write in batches of 4 (same content type) for efficiency
- **Seasonal hooks**: Plan content around industry events, product launches, budget cycles

## Promotion Checklist (per piece)
1. **Social distribution** (Day 0): Thread on Twitter/X, LinkedIn post, relevant social channels
2. **Community seeding** (Day 0-1): Share in relevant communities as helpful resource (not self-promotion)
3. **Email blast** (Day 1): Send to subscriber list with compelling subject line
4. **Outreach** (Day 1-3): Email anyone mentioned, linked, or quoted in the piece
5. **Repurpose** (Day 3-7): Create derivative content (see repurposing framework below)
6. **Internal link** (Day 7): Add links from existing content to new piece and vice versa

## Repurposing Framework (1 → 7)
One long-form article becomes:
1. **Twitter/X thread**: 5-7 key insights as individual tweets
2. **LinkedIn post**: Single key insight expanded into a narrative
3. **Short-form video**: 60-second summary of the main takeaway
4. **Newsletter excerpt**: 200-word summary with link to full article
5. **Carousel/infographic**: Key data or steps as visual slides
6. **Podcast talking point**: Discuss the topic on your or others' podcasts
7. **Community answer**: Answer related questions on forums linking back as source
