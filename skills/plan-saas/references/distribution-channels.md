# Distribution Channels Reference

## Channel Deep Dives

### SEO (Organic Search)
- **Time to results**: 3-6 months for initial rankings, 6-12 months for meaningful traffic
- **Effort**: High upfront (content creation), medium ongoing (optimization + new content)
- **Best for**: Products with searchable problems, broad markets, long-term play
- **Not for**: Novel categories no one searches for yet, time-sensitive launches
- **Key metric**: Organic signups/month
- **Investment**: $0 (DIY) to $3-5K/mo (writer + SEO tool)

### Content Marketing (non-SEO)
- **Time to results**: 1-3 months (depends on distribution, not just publishing)
- **Effort**: High (writing is time-consuming even with AI assistance)
- **Best for**: Products requiring education, complex value props, B2B
- **Key metric**: Email signups from content, content-attributed trials
- **Investment**: $0 (DIY) to $2-4K/mo (writers)

### Social Media (organic)
- **Time to results**: 2-4 weeks for engagement, 2-3 months for meaningful following
- **Effort**: Medium (consistency matters more than quality)
- **Best for**: B2B (Twitter/X, LinkedIn), consumer (Instagram, TikTok), developer tools (Twitter/X)
- **Platform selection**: Go where your ICP is. Don't be on every platform.
- **Key metric**: Profile visits → website clicks → signups
- **Investment**: $0 (DIY time only)

### Paid Acquisition (Google Ads, Meta, etc.)
- **Time to results**: Days (immediate traffic), 2-4 weeks (optimized campaigns)
- **Effort**: Medium (setup) + ongoing optimization
- **Best for**: Products with clear BOFU keywords, proven conversion funnels, positive unit economics
- **When to start**: AFTER you have product-market fit signals. Paid amplifies, it doesn't create PMF.
- **Key metric**: CAC, ROAS
- **Investment**: $500-2K/mo test budget → scale what works

### Email Marketing
- **Time to results**: Immediate (if you have a list), 2-3 months to build a list
- **Effort**: Low-Medium (templates + automation)
- **Best for**: ALL SaaS products. Email is owned audience — not dependent on algorithms.
- **Key metric**: Open rate (>25% good), click rate (>3% good), email-attributed revenue
- **Investment**: $0-50/mo (ConvertKit/Loops free tier → paid)

### Community / Forums
- **Time to results**: 4-8 weeks of genuine participation before any promotion
- **Effort**: Medium (requires consistent presence, not just drive-by posting)
- **Best for**: Niche products, developer tools, products solving community-discussed problems
- **Platforms**: Reddit, HackerNews, niche forums, Discord/Slack communities
- **Key metric**: Referral traffic from communities, brand mentions
- **Investment**: $0 (time only, 30 min/day)

### Partnerships / Integrations
- **Time to results**: 2-4 months (relationship building + integration work)
- **Effort**: High (but compounds over time)
- **Best for**: Products that enhance existing workflows, B2B
- **Key metric**: Integration-attributed signups, co-marketing reach
- **Investment**: Development time for integrations

### Cold Outreach
- **Time to results**: 1-2 weeks (fast feedback loop)
- **Effort**: Medium-High (personalization is key — no mass templates)
- **Best for**: B2B with high LTV (>$100/mo), products that need hand-holding for activation
- **Key metric**: Response rate (>15% is good), meeting → trial rate
- **Investment**: $0-100/mo (email warmup + verification tools)

## Prioritization Matrix

For each channel, score 1-5 on each factor then multiply by weight:
| Factor | Weight | Description |

| Time-to-revenue | 25% | How quickly does this channel produce paying customers? |
| Founder ability | 20% | Can you execute this channel well given your skills? |
| Scalability | 15% | Does this channel grow beyond founder effort? |
| Cost efficiency | 10% | What's the CAC relative to LTV for this channel? |

**Select 3 primary channels** (highest weighted scores) and **2 secondary channels** (next highest). Focus resources on primary until they're optimized before scaling to secondary.
