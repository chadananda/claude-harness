# Viability Scoring Rubric

Multiplicative scoring: Score_1 × Score_2 × Score_3 × Score_4 × Score_5. One zero kills everything — intentional.

## Factor 1: Product (10x Better)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 (Disqualifier) | Me-too product, no meaningful differentiation. Existing solutions are "good enough." |
| 1 (Weak) | 10-30% better in one dimension. Incremental improvement competitors can match quickly. |
| 2 (Strong) | 2-5x better on a dimension that matters to the ICP. Clear differentiation story. |
| 3 (Exceptional) | 10x+ improvement or creates entirely new category. Paradigm shift. |

Challenge prompts:
- "What if [biggest competitor] copies this feature tomorrow?"
- "Show me a user who tried alternatives and explain why they'd switch."

Research queries: `existing solutions for [problem]`, `[competitor] reviews complaints`, `alternatives to [current solution]`

## Factor 2: Acquisition (Find Users)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | No idea how to reach users. "Build it and they will come" mentality. |
| 1 | Expensive channels only (paid ads, cold outreach). CAC likely > first-year revenue. |
| 2 | Proven channels available (SEO, content, communities). Reasonable CAC. |
| 3 | Built-in virality, existing audience, or distribution moat (marketplace, platform, network effects). |

Challenge prompts:
- "What's your realistic CAC? How does that compare to first-year LTV?"
- "Name 3 specific places where your first 100 users hang out right now."

Research queries: `how [target users] discover [product category]`, `[industry] customer acquisition cost benchmarks`

## Factor 3: Market (Size & Growth)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Market <$10M or actively declining. Niche too small for sustainable business. |
| 1 | Small market ($10M-$100M) or flat growth. Lifestyle business territory. |
| 2 | Medium market ($100M-$1B) with positive growth trends. |
| 3 | Large market (>$1B) with strong tailwinds (regulatory, technology, demographic shifts). |

Challenge prompts:
- "Are you defining your market too broadly to seem big, or too narrowly to seem focused?"
- "What happens if [major trend] reverses?"

Research queries: `[industry] market size [current year]`, `[space] growth rate CAGR`, `VC investment in [category]`

## Factor 4: Defendability (Hard to Copy)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Trivially copyable. No moats, no switching costs, no network effects. |
| 1 | Weak moats — brand recognition or first-mover advantage only. |
| 2 | Multiple moats — data advantages + switching costs, or network effects + brand. |
| 3 | Structural moats — strong network effects, proprietary data that compounds, regulatory barriers. |

Challenge prompts:
- "What stops Google/Microsoft from adding this as a feature?"
- "If an open-source alternative appeared tomorrow, why would users still pay you?"

Research queries: `defensibility patterns in [industry]`, `[successful competitor] competitive moat analysis`

## Factor 5: Buildability (Can Execute)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Missing critical capabilities with no clear path to acquire them. Requires $1M+ to reach MVP. |
| 1 | Significant gaps — need co-founder with key skills, 6+ month timeline, external funding required. |
| 2 | Achievable — team has core skills, 2-4 month MVP timeline, bootstrappable. |
| 3 | Unfair advantage — domain expertise + technical skills + existing assets. Can ship MVP in weeks. |

Challenge prompts:
- "What's the hardest technical problem, and have you built anything similar before?"
- "If your timeline doubles, can you survive financially?"

Research queries: `technical requirements for [product type]`, `MVP timeline for [category] startups`

## Score Zones

| Zone | Range | Interpretation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Red | 0-9 | Below viability threshold. Iterate before proceeding. |
| Yellow | 10-19 | Promising but risky. Proceed with caution, shore up weakest factors. |
| Green | 20-49 | Solid foundation. Build MVP and validate with real users. |
| Elite | 50-99 | Strong across all factors. Consider raising capital. |
| Unicorn | 100+ | Exceptional. All factors at maximum. Rare and valuable. |

Maximum possible score: 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 243. A score of 0 on any single factor = 0 total.
