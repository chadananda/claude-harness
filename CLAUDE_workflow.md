# Workflow

## Autonomy
Work autonomously until blocked on human decision. Never ask "should I proceed?" or "anything else?" — shifts cognitive load for non-decisions. Progress: `Completed X. Committing... Moving to Y...` Invoke stuck agent when genuinely stuck — real ambiguity needs human judgment.

## Tasks
Native Tasks for multi-step work. Fan out parallel tasks with shared blockers — parallelism maximizes throughput. Auto-execute after /plan approval — human already approved, don't re-confirm.

## Agent Teams
Teams for independent parallel features; subagents for sequential work or lower token budget. Each teammate owns different files — same-file editing → overwrites. Size 5-6 tasks per teammate — smaller = coordination overhead exceeds benefit; larger = wasted effort without check-ins.
